# Project Update – Real-Time Weather Dashboard Using Weather API 🌐
Excited to share my second project! 🚀
I developed a Weather Forecast Dashboard that displays real-time data like temperature, humidity, air quality, wind speed, and 7-day forecasts using a Weather API. The dashboard includes:
Key Functionalities:
👉 Live temperature display with location-specific conditions (Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, etc.)
📈 7-day forecast chart with temperature trends
💨 Wind speed, humidity, pressure, and visibility indicators
🌄 Sunrise & sunset tracking
☔ Rainfall probability with progress bars
🌫️ Air Quality Index with pollutants: CO, NO₂, PM2.5, PM10, O₃, SO₂
🌞 UV Index and precipitation status
📌 This project enhances user engagement through clear visuals, live updates, and data-driven UI components. It’s a step toward my goal of building intelligent, real-world applications.
